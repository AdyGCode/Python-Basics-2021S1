# Created:  13/05/2021
# Purpose:  GUI Guessing Game version 3
#
# Duplicate the second version of the guessing game.
#
# You will enhance this version of the game by:
#   5) Add a new label that shows the number of guesses taken
#   starting at 1, and increment every time a new guess is made.
#   6) When the user guessed the number, disable the guess button.
#   7) When the user guesses the number, display a "play again"
#   button that will restart the game with a new number and the count
#   reset. Remember to enable the guess button and hide the play
#   again button.
