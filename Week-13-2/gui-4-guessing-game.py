# Created:  13/05/2021
# Purpose:  GUI Guessing Game version 4
#
# Duplicate the third version of the guessing game.
#
# You will enhance this version of the game by:
#   8) When the user wins, ask them for their initials (must be three
#   of the following characters: A-Z or asterisk (*).
#   9) Append the user initials and score to a file called
#   "HighScores.csv". They should be added in the form: "INITIALS",0
#   10) Add a Quit button that allows the user to exit the game - use
#   the self.quit() method to exit the application cleanly.
